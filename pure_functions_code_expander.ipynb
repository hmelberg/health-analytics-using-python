        "One key problem when dealing with medical codes, is how to describe a group of codes that make up a disease in a short and efficient manner. For instance, there are many dozens of codes that belong under the general category of liver disease. Listing all codes every time we want to select a group of patients with a given conditions, becomes very cumbersome. Instead, we will develop a notation where you can use stars, hyphens and colons to describe sets of medical codes, and functions that expand the shorthand codes to the full set of codes.\n",

        "The [Charlson Comorbidity Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity#Charlson_index) is used to measure the frailty a patient. For instance, when comparing two differnt treatments, it is important to make sure that the patients not only have the same severity of the disease, but also that they have the same level of general health. The Charlson Comorbidity index measures this by assinging each patient a score based on the existence of codes for different comorbidities. Here is an example of the comorbidities, their weights, and the medical codes behind the comorbidities from [Lee et al. 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.5051/jpis.2018.48.2.92):\n",

        "\n",
        "There are several different indicies and one could argue - and people do, of course! - about which index to use and how well the index captures how frail a patient is. One of the reasons there are different versions, is that coding systems differ across time and countries. This means that the precise codes that goes into the calculation will differ. Moreover, the score is supposed to be related to the probability of dying, and this has led some to create new categories and weights that they believe better reflect the importance of each comorbodity for the probability that a patient will die.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an overview of some of these various versions from an article by [Fernando et al. in 2019](https://https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279719301036) (See also [Lagergren and Brusselaers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29582935) for another good overview).\n",

        "While it is useful to know the background of the index and the different versions, these discussions are not the focus of this notebook. Instead, the aim is to use the task of calculating the index as a case study for how to develop notation to express groups of codes and, in the second step, use these groups to calculate indicies such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In short, to calculate the index we have to: \n",
        "  - Create a data structure the describe the different diseases and their  medical codes\n",
        "  - Calculate how many of the diseases each patient has and create a weighted sum for each patient based on the diagnoses she has\n",

This illustrates the importance of knowing Python in general in order to build efficient tools for data science. Some might feel that this is not their cup of tea, in which case you can skip this notebook and use the notation we develop without knowing the details behind how it works. \n"

Hyphens simply insert numbers in increasing order, but star notation requires an external codelist from which we can pick the codes conform with the given string. For instance, 'K50' should include all codes that start with *K50*, but we need the full set of codes to know which codes that start with *K50*. We can get this list in two ways:\n",

Repeatedly constructing a list of codes from information in columns might be time consuming with large dataframes, and we should be careful to do it in the most efficient manner possible. Also, using the existing codes to define a list of codes, might not identify all possible codes. Instead it will only identify all those codes that have been used in the data. Expansion using 'all codes in my data' as opposed 'all codes in the official codebook' may produce different results. For many purposes we only want a list of those codes that actually exist in the data - and including irrelevant codes would just make things slower. But it is a difference one should be aware of.\n",

        "We might, however, make the notation slightly more flexible. Instad of only allowing the user to search for everything that starts with a given pattern,  one might allow searching for all codes that end with a given string, for instance everything that ends with **B3*. Even more advanced, one could allow stars in the middle: Searching for codes that start with something and end with something. Finally, if more advanced searches are desired, we could allow expansion based on a regex pattern i.e. include those codes in a codelist that conform to a pattern described by a regex expression. Lastly, there might be codes that actually have stars and hyphens as part of the code itself - in which case we have to be careful not to expand the codes as if the hyphen or star were notational symbols (for instance by introducing a *raw=True* argument to indicate that the codes should not be expanded).\n",
